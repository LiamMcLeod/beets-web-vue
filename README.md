Beets Web Alternative
===

Just a simple front-end for beets using the Spectre CSS framework, I've kept changes to the original Backbone code to a minimum as there's no use trying to fix something which isn't broken, it does the job and works well, why change it.

Therefore much of the credit goes to [beetbox](https://github.com/beetbox) and the contributors to the original repo [beets](https://github.com/beetbox/beets)
