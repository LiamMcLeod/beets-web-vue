Beets Web Alternative
===

Just a simple front-end for beets using the Spectre CSS framework. I've migrated the original code from Backbone to Vue just for the fun of it, to relearn the framework, a lot of it was simple Copy+Paste. 

Therefore much of the credit goes to [beetbox](https://github.com/beetbox) and the contributors to the original repo [beets](https://github.com/beetbox/beets)
